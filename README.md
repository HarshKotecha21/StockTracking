Project Title: Stock Tracking App

Project Description: 
The Stock Tracking App is a C# WinForms application designed to manage stock inventory and sales. Utilizing the Facade design pattern and ADO.NET, the application offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to streamline stock monitoring and customer-related tasks.

Key Features:

Stock Alert Form: The application starts with a Stock Alert Form that triggers whenever the stock amount of a product falls below a certain threshold. This alert ensures that the business is promptly notified when stock needs replenishment.

Products Form: The Products Form displays a comprehensive list of available products, including details such as product name, category, price, and current stock levels. It allows easy navigation and access to product information.

Add Stock Form: With the Add Stock Form, users can update stock levels by inputting new stock quantities for specific products. This feature ensures accurate tracking and prevents stockouts.

Sales Form: The Sales Form enables users to record customer transactions, including product sold, quantity, and customer details. It calculates the total sale amount and updates stock levels accordingly.

Customers Form: The Customers Form maintains a database of customer information, such as names, contact details, and transaction history. It facilitates efficient customer management and personalized service.

Deleted Form: The Deleted Form keeps a record of deleted products and sales, allowing users to restore or refer to historical data if needed.
